Not the final version (I hope)

This version can:
  - operation for two numbers (no more)
  - only integer (not float)
  - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
  - "dark GUI mode"
  - control only with buttons
  - "C" button for reset

Upgrade points:
  - calculations with any number of numbers
  - change to float numbers
  - add percentage calculation
