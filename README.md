  - operation for two numbers (no more)
  - counting with both int and float
  - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
  - "dark GUI mode"
  - control only with buttons
  - "C" button for reset

  - button for comma
  - float numbers
  - buttons with border radius
  - fixed bugs with operations with 0

Planned upgrade points:
  - calculations with any number of numbers
  - add percentage calculation
  - add exponentation
  - ...
